#FIREWALL 

in this repo we look at how to block all incoming and outgoing traffic through the firewall

[0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](./0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but) => command to block all except 22,443 and 80

[100-port_forwarding](./100-port_forwarding) => ufw configuration to for all set ups of ufw both port_forwarding and allowing connections and denying outgoing connections
